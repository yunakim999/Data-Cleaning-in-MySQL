# Data-Cleaning-in-MySQL
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a dataset for further analysis. The primary goal is to ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for use.

Steps Undertaken:
1. Remove Duplicates
Identified and removed duplicate entries to ensure each record is unique.

2. Standardize the Data
Addressed issues with inconsistent spellings, formatting errors, and other discrepancies to standardize the dataset.

3. Handle Null or Blank Values
Managed missing or blank values by either imputing appropriate values (industry field) or removing affected records, depending on the context and impact on analysis.

4. Remove Unnecessary Rows
Deleted irrelevant or redundant rows to streamline the dataset and enhance its quality.
